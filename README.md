# New York Times Best Seller App
The New York Times Best Seller App allows users to search through a list of book categories presented in a picker view and loads a collection of books for a specific genre. Each book in the collection provides the user with an image of the book cover along with a brief description of the book. 

Clicking into one of the books will present a detailed view of the book containing the author, title, and description of the book. There are also links available to purchase the books through Amazon, iBooks, Barnes & Nobles. Users will have the option to favorite a book and save it to their Favorites folder.

The app persists data so closing and reopening the app will land on the same book category.
